Add installation steps for VS Code.
If there are existing steps, add a new section for VS Code in the same style.

Generating install badges and CLI commands based on Example config. Use the VS Code tools.

There is no need to do any codebase search. 

There is no need to use any other tools.

Avoid creating a section header for the VS Code button itself. It should just appear below the installation steps.

Look for any place in the README where the are currently instfuctions for coniguraiton MCP clients. If you find such a section, add the new VS Code section in the same format as the other clients/tools.
